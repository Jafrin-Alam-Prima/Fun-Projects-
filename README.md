## Hit Hasina with a Sandal

This is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a sandal to hit falling images of Hasina.

### How to Play

- Use the **left and right arrow keys** to move the sandal.
- Hit the falling Hasinas to score points.
- There are two types of Hasinas:
    - **Large Hasinas:** Slower and worth 1 point.
    - **Small Hasinas:** Faster and worth 3 points.
- You have 5 lives. You lose a life for each Hasina that gets past you.
- The game is over when you run out of lives.
